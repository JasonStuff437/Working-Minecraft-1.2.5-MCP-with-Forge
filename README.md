# Working-Minecraft-1.2.5-MCP-with-Forge
Well its the year 2019 and here I am trying to make a mod for 1.2.5. Specifically a SkinPatch for Tekkit Classic 3.1.2.

Anyways, after hours upon hours of searching how to setup MCP with Forge, and repeatedly failing
due to decompiling errors, missing fernflower.jar, etc, I FINALLY got it working while scouring
every corner of the internet. As soon as I got this working, I posted it on here for archiving
purposes! Hopefully this helps some of you guys out there trying to revive the once beloved 
1.2.5
